Brief Description: 

  This is the fourth place entry in the third round of the NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to produce differentially private synthetic data while retaining as much useful information as possible about the original data set.   Colorado census data from 1940 with 98 field columns were provided for algorithm development with census data from other states used for testing.
