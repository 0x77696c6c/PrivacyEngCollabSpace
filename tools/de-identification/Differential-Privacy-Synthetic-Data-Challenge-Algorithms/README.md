<h1>Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge Algorithms</h1>

<strong>De-identification Keywords:</strong> Differential Privacy, Synthetic Data Generation

<strong>Brief Description:</strong> Participants in Match #3 of the [2018 Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/funding-opportunities/prizes-challenges/2018-differential-privacy-synthetic-data-challenge) developed these open source algorithms as part of an effort to advance differential privacy. Participants were challenged to create new methods, or improve existing methods of data de-identification, while preserving the datasetâ€™s utility for analysis. All solutions were required to satisfy the differential privacy guarantee, a provable guarantee of individual privacy protection. Participants used a data set of emergency response events occurring in San Francisco and a sub-sample of the IPUMS USA data for the 1940 U.S. Census.
