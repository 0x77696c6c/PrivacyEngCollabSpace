# GUPT: Privacy preserving data analysis made easy

**De-identification Keywords:** Differential Privacy, Machine
  Learning, Database Queries

**Brief Description:** The tool provides differential privacy
guarantees to statistical/machine learning algorithms by treating the
underlying algorithm as a black-box, and only relying on input/output
signatures. It implements a variant of the celebrated sample and
aggregate framework by Nissim, Rashkhodnikova, and Smith, 2007. The
empirical evaluation shows that the system scores well on various
learning tasks (like clustering and regression).
